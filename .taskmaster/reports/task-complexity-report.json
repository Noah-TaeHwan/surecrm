      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor Breakpoint Strategy and Layout System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the refactoring of the breakpoint strategy and layout system into subtasks such as: updating breakpoint logic, integrating Tailwind CSS breakpoints, implementing ResponsiveLayout, implementing FlexibleSidebar, updating all layout components for responsiveness, integrating with React Router v7 and TypeScript, and comprehensive cross-browser/device testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves a fundamental architectural change affecting the entire layout system, requiring updates to breakpoint logic, integration of new libraries, component refactoring, and extensive cross-device testing. The breadth and depth of changes, as well as the need for regression testing, make it highly complex."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Adaptive Navigation System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Adaptive Navigation System into granular steps, including device detection, navigation variants for each device type, accessibility, responsive styling, transition handling, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multi-platform adaptive UI logic, device detection, three distinct navigation paradigms, accessibility, and responsive design. It requires integrating multiple libraries and ensuring seamless transitions, which increases cyclomatic and structural complexity. More subtasks are needed to cover device detection, each navigation variant, accessibility, transitions, and robust testing."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize Content Area and Touch Targets",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the optimization process into subtasks for auditing, updating padding, applying touch target classes, integrating responsive utilities, and validating usability and accessibility.",
      "reasoning": "This task is focused and well-scoped, involving UI adjustments and accessibility improvements. The main complexity lies in ensuring consistency and compliance across all interactive elements, but the logic is straightforward and mostly involves refactoring and testing."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Responsive Data Display Components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the development of responsive data display into subtasks for detection logic, TableView, CardView with swipe, integration, accessibility, and performance testing.",
      "reasoning": "Switching between table and card views based on device, implementing swipe gestures, and ensuring accessibility introduces moderate-to-high complexity. Each component and the integration logic require careful design and testing, especially for performance and usability."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Touch-Optimized Modals and Forms",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the modal and form optimization into subtasks for modal design, accessibility integration, touch-friendly controls, keyboard handling, styling, and end-to-end testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves redesigning modals for mobile, accessibility, touch targets, and keyboard-aware layouts. While each aspect is individually manageable, their combination and the need for robust testing raise the overall complexity."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor Dashboard for Mobile Responsiveness",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the dashboard refactor into subtasks for urgent UI fixes, grid redesign, card slider, KPI prioritization, accessibility, cross-device testing, performance optimization, and user feedback validation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a critical, urgent task with high business impact, requiring immediate fixes, major layout changes, new interaction patterns, and comprehensive testing. The need for rapid delivery, coordination, and validation across devices makes it highly complex."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the touch optimization into subtasks for horizontal scrolling, touch-based drag-and-drop, calendar redesign, responsive styling, accessibility, and end-to-end testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing advanced touch interactions, integrating third-party libraries, and ensuring accessibility and performance. The interaction between scrolling and drag-and-drop adds to the complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Mobile-Specific Features",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the implementation of mobile-specific features into subtasks for pull-to-refresh, swipe gestures, offline mode, mobile search optimization, integration, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "Adding mobile-only features like offline mode, pull-to-refresh, and gesture navigation involves integrating multiple libraries and handling edge cases, increasing both cyclomatic and structural complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Enable PWA and Offline Support",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose PWA and offline support into subtasks for manifest creation, service worker integration, offline mode implementation, installability, local data caching, and end-to-end testing.",
      "reasoning": "Converting to a PWA and adding offline support involves several distinct technical steps, but each is well-understood and supported by existing tools. The main complexity is in integration and testing."
