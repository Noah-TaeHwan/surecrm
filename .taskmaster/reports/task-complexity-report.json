      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor Breakpoint Strategy and Layout System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the refactoring of the breakpoint strategy and layout system into subtasks such as: updating breakpoint logic, integrating Tailwind CSS breakpoints, implementing ResponsiveLayout, implementing FlexibleSidebar, updating all layout components for responsiveness, integrating with React Router v7 and TypeScript, and comprehensive cross-browser/device testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves a fundamental architectural change affecting the entire layout system, requiring updates to breakpoint logic, integration of new libraries, component refactoring, and extensive cross-device testing. The breadth and depth of changes, as well as the need for regression testing, make it highly complex."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Adaptive Navigation System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the adaptive navigation system into subtasks such as: device detection logic, desktop sidebar implementation, tablet collapsible sidebar, mobile bottom tab navigation, styling with ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS, and accessibility/touch target compliance testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires building multiple navigation paradigms for different devices, integrating device detection, ensuring accessibility, and maintaining consistent user experience, all of which add significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize Content Area and Touch Targets",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the optimization into subtasks: updating content area padding, applying touch-target class to all interactive elements, ensuring responsive sizing with Tailwind CSS, and accessibility/WCAG compliance testing.",
      "reasoning": "While the changes are mostly styling and accessibility-focused, they require careful review of all interactive elements and thorough testing, making the task moderately complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Responsive Data Display Components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: implement TableView for desktop, implement CardView for mobile, add device size detection and switching logic, integrate swipe gestures, and test for performance and information hierarchy.",
      "reasoning": "Switching between different data display paradigms and ensuring smooth transitions and usability across devices introduces both UI and logic complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Touch-Optimized Modals and Forms",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: design FlexibleModal for full-screen mobile, integrate react-modal for accessibility, update form inputs and buttons for touch, implement keyboard-aware layouts, and perform mobile accessibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "Redesigning modals and forms for mobile involves UI, accessibility, and interaction logic, especially for keyboard handling and touch optimization."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor Dashboard for Mobile Responsiveness",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: update dashboard grid for responsive columns, implement card slider with swipe gestures, prioritize KPI widgets, and test grid adaptation and performance.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires grid logic changes, swipe gesture integration, and prioritization of content, but is limited in scope to the dashboard."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize Pipeline and Calendar for Touch",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: implement horizontal scrolling for pipeline, add touch-based deal movement, redesign calendar controls for touch, integrate react-draggable or custom handlers, optimize react-big-calendar for mobile, and test accessibility/performance.",
      "reasoning": "Touch optimization for complex modules like pipeline and calendar involves significant UI and interaction logic changes, as well as third-party library integration and testing."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Mobile-Specific Features",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: implement pull-to-refresh, add swipe gestures for navigation/actions, enable offline mode with local storage/IndexedDB, optimize mobile search interface, and test all features on mobile devices.",
      "reasoning": "Adding mobile-only features requires integrating multiple libraries, handling offline scenarios, and ensuring smooth user experience, which increases complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Enable PWA and Offline Support",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: add PWA manifest, implement service worker with workbox-webpack-plugin, enable offline caching for core features, and test installation/offline behavior.",
      "reasoning": "Converting to a PWA and adding offline support involves configuration, service worker logic, and testing, but is well-supported by existing tools and libraries."
